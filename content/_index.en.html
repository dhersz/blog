<p>Hi! Iâ€™m <strong>Daniel Herszenhut</strong>, MSc student in Transport Engineering at <a href="http://pet.coppe.ufrj.br/index.php/pt/">PET/COPPE/UFRJ</a> and research assistant at <a href="https://www.ipea.gov.br/acessooportunidades/en/sobre/">Access to Opportunities Project</a>. I try to understand, with my research, how transport equity analysis are affected by incorporating the monetary costs of trips in accessibility measures.</p>
<p>My research interests mainly revolve around Urban Mobility, particularly Transport Justice. I believe data science should be used to expand the knowledge frontier and I take part in the development of <a href="/en/projects"><em>R</em> packages</a> to make the life of those who work in these areas easier.</p>
<p>In my leisure time I like to practice outdoor activities and study/play music, especially percussion instruments.</p>
