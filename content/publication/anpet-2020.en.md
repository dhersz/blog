#### Abstract

Accessibility estimates are often based on measures that only take into account travel time impedance, ignoring other factors that hinder the access of individuals to activities, such as trip monetary cost. This paper examines how and to what extent incorporating monetary cost in a cumulative opportunity measure impacts transportation equity analysis, looking at transit job accessibility in the city of Rio de Janeiro. In order to estimate socio-spatial job accessibility inequalities, high spatial resolution door-to-door travel matrixes have been calculated under different travel time and monetary cost thresholds. It has been found that considering tighter monetary constraints reveal larger accessibility gaps between the richest and the poorest income groups. The study shows how transport equity analysis that overlook the monetary cost of transit trips tend to underestimate social and spatial inequalities in access to opportunities.
