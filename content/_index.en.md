Hi! I'm **Daniel Herszenhut**, MSc student in Transport Engineering at [PET/COPPE/UFRJ](http://pet.coppe.ufrj.br/index.php/pt/) and research assistant at [Access to Opportunities Project](https://www.ipea.gov.br/acessooportunidades/en/sobre/). I try to understand, with my research, how transport equity analysis are affected by incorporating the monetary costs of trips in accessibility measures.

My research interests mainly revolve around Urban Mobility, particularly Transport Justice. I believe data science should be used to expand the knowledge frontier and I take part in the development of [*R* packages]({{< ref "/projects.en" >}}) to make the life of those who work in these areas easier.

In my leisure time I like to practice outdoor activities and study/play music, especially percussion instruments.
